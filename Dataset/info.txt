##About the Dataset
The dataset offers vital information about factors influencing traffic flow, enabling the development of accurate traffic volume prediction models. Key features include:

Time: Timestamp of the recorded data.
Weather Conditions: Information such as temperature, precipitation, and visibility.
Holiday Information: Flags indicating public holidays that may impact traffic.
Other Contextual Factors: Additional details contributing to traffic flow variations.
These features are used to predict traffic volume at a specific point in time.

Dataset Files
Train.csv:
Contains historical traffic data, including traffic volume and the associated features. This file will be used to train the predictive model.

Test.csv:
Includes the dataset for which traffic predictions will be generated. This file is used for model evaluation and prediction.

By leveraging this dataset, the project aims to create a highly accurate traffic forecasting model, contributing to better traffic management and planning systems.
